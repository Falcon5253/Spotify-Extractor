# Spotift Extractor
## What it does
It extracts songs from your favourites.
## How it works
It works fine. All you need to do is start the program and input the amount of songs you want to extract, then after the program is completed it creates two text files with songs.
## What is needed
It requires python interpretator and installed "spotipy" library.
## Problems?
This is not a commercial application, so to use it you need to request an access first.
Do not input the number that is bigger than amount of your tracks in total.
